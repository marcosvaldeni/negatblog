# :memo: Description
This ongoing frontend project is a requirement of the Ignite bootcamp program and is being developed using React. The project will consume the GitHub API as its backend and will use the 'issues' endpoint to build a blog. The main function of the blog will be to show posts from the issue repository. Whenever a post is made on the issue repository, it will show up on the blog paper. This project is still in development and aims to create an efficient and user-friendly blog for the community.
